            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>The common semantic model is one of the key building blocks of the BDI: a common terminology framework. A semantic model (ontology) is a formal description of terms and relationships between these terms in a way that allows computers to interpret the terms. It is the key foundation for software developers that need to create links and translations. A standardised semantic model makes it easier to develop standardised APIs to request data from the source.</p>

            <p>A semantic model also allows the application of so-called Semantic Web technology (SPARQL queryable endpoint with a triple store for example). And last but not least, a semantic model is a precondition for many AI applications. Standard ways of requesting the data from the source are essential when many parties are active in a network.</p>
