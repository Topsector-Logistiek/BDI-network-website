            <h4>BDI Ontology</h4>
            <p>The BDI ontology follows the FEDeRATED principles, and builds upon existing logistic domain models, namely UN/CEFACT CCL and Open Trip Model. This is supplemented with Linked Data standards which are strong in a niche aspect, such a Geometries or Units and Measures. </p>

            <p>The ontology is developed in a use case driven manner, the first use case is the ‘Delivery Profile’ use case.</p> 
            
            <p>The ontology can be found on GitHub.</p>
