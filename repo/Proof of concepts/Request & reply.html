            <h4>Request/reply</h4>

            <p>This scenario supports two different flows and related implementation; a peer-to-peer request and an authority request.</p>

            <p>The peer-to-peer request/reply flow supports an API which executes predefined SPARQL queries that can be executed on the entire dataset in the Triple store. This flow supports an example Delivery profile case where the requester uses a chatbot (HeyWim from Poort8).</p>

            <p>The authority request/reply flow supports a SPARQL-endpoint which allows user-defined SPARQL queries to be executed on periodically updated subsets of the entire dataset in the Triple store.</p>

            <p>This flow supports an example eFTI case where the authority requests eCMR data.</p>
